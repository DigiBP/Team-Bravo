## Project concept
We are building a virtual Pharmacy store called Pharma24 that provides an
API for checking pharmaceutical products availability in a hospital.

In general, the hospital sends a prescription receipt via an API to Pharma24, where
the online pharmacy store checks the received information such as user data, product information and product availability / stock.

The products of the online pharmacy can be collected using a vending machine that checks the user information such as an invitation code, usersâ€™ identity and coverage of the insurance company.

## General Features

1.	User eligibility check
2.	Health insurance coverage check
3.	Product availability check
